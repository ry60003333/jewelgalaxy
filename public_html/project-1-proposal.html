                    <h2>High Concept</h2>
                    <p>It is like Bejeweled, but better! It allows for a more free form experience, where the player is not limited by a grid.</p>

                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                    <p>Colored pairs of planets will spawn and move around on the game screen. The main mechanic of the game is collision; when two planets
                        of the same color collide, they annihilate each other. When two planets of different colors collide, they simply
                        bounce off of each other. The goal of the game is eliminate all of the planets.</p>


                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>The main control of the game is clicking (or maybe tapping) on the game screen; This
                        creates an explosion that will push planets away from the origin of the explosion.
                        The closer that a planet is to the origin of the explosion, the further it will move.</p>

                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>Scoring will be based off of both the time it takes the player to complete the level, 
                        and how many clicks it took the player to beat the level.</p>

                    <h3>Onboarding and Teaching the game</h3>
                    <p>The player will be taught how to play the game by integrating the learning process with
                        the game play. The first level will teach the player the main mechanic and the controls of the game.</p>

                    <h3>Player learning</h3>
                    <p>In order to beat the game, the player needs to learn how to manipulate the planets into
                        bouncing into other planets of the game color by using the force generated by clicking
                        appropriately.</p>

                    <h2>Other</h2>
                    <p>We may want to use a physics library to handle angles, collisions, and so on. Possibly <a href="http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/">PhysicsJS</a>.</p>
                    <p>In addition, music from <a href="http://www.nosoapradio.us/">www.nosoapradio.us</a> is used, along with creative commons licensed images from Google Images.</p>
                    <p>We also utilized <a href="http://deepliquid.com/blog/archives/98">this</a> tutorial for help with drawing arrows.</p>
                    <p>The NPM package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/line-circle-collision">line-circle-collision</a> is used for collision detection.</p>
